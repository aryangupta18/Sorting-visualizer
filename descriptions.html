        <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
        <div class="content">
            Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements in the string, from left to right, switching their positions if they are out of order. The algorithm then repeats this process until it can run through the entire string and find no two elements that need to be swapped.
            <h4>Advantages of Bubble Sort:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It does not require any additional memory space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.

            </ul>

        <h3>Selection Sort</h3>
        <div class="content">
            Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
            <h4>Advantages of Selection Sort:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Simple and easy to understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Works well with small datasets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Selection Sort:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not work well on large datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort:</h4>
            
            <ul>The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2) as there are two nested loops:
                <li>
                    One loop to select an element of Array one by one = O(N)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another loop to compare that element with every other Array element = O(N)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N*N) = O(N^2)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables while swapping two values in Array. The selection sort never makes more than O(N) swaps and can be useful when memory writing is costly.
